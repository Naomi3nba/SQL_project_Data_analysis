## üìö Background:
This project was completed as part of the SQL Portfolio Project from Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL course  https://lukeb.co/sql. 

- üéØ The goal was to apply real-world SQL skills to analyze job postings data and extract actionable insights relevant to the role of a Data Analyst in Norway. 
- üìä The analysis includes salary trends, required and in-demand skills, and a breakdown of the most valuable competencies to focus on for career growth.

## üîß Tools Used:  

- **SQL** ‚Äì To extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the job postings database.

- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì As the relational database management system for running and testing queries.

- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì For writing and organizing SQL scripts in a clean and efficient environment.

- **GitHub** ‚Äì To document, version, and share the project as part of my portfolio.

## üìà The Analysis

In this project, I analyzed job postings for Data Analyst roles in Norway using SQL. The goal was to identify the top-paying positions, the key skills required for those jobs, and determine which skills are most in-demand and best paid. By combining salary data with skill frequency, I was also able to highlight the most optimal skills to learn for maximizing opportunities in the Norwegian data job market.

### Question 1Ô∏è‚É£: 

- What are the 15 top-paying job for 'Data Analyst' in Norway?

```sql
SELECT 
job_id,
job_title_short,
job_location,
job_via,
job_schedule_type,
salary_year_avg,
company_dim.name AS Company_name,
job_posted_date

FROM job_postings_fact

LEFT JOIN company_dim ON
job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id


WHERE 
job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
job_country = 'Norway' AND
salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY
salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 15;
```

‚≠ê Here is the breakdown of the **TOP ANALYST** for the position **Data Analyst** roles in **Norway**:

- **The top-paying Data Analyst position in Norway offered an annual salary of 98,500 USD**, posted by Unacast in Oslo. Most high-paying roles were full-time and concentrated in Oslo, with companies like Statkraft and CGG appearing multiple times. 

- This suggests that **Oslo is a central hub for data analytics roles in Norway**, with competitive salaries in the sector.

- In comparison, **Data Scientist** roles offer **significantly higher salaries than Data Analyst positions in Norway. The top-paying Data Scientist jobs reach up to 157,500 USD annually, while the highest salary for a Data Analyst role is 98,500 USD.** This indicates a notable gap in compensation, reflecting the greater technical complexity and advanced skills typically required for Data Scientist positions.

## üßê What I learn:

This project helped me strengthen my skills in SQL data analysis and gave me hands-on experience working with real-world job market data. Some key learnings include:

- Using **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) to organize complex queries, especially for filtering and ranking the top-paying jobs.

- **JOIN** operations (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) were essential to combine job data with skills and company information across multiple tables.

- Aggregation functions like **COUNT() and AVG()** were crucial for measuring skill demand and calculating average salaries.

- Filtering and sorting with **WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT** helped isolate the most relevant jobs (e.g., top 15 Data Analyst roles in Norway).

- **GROUP BY** and subqueries enabled skill-level analysis by demand and salary.

## ‚≠ê Conclusions:

- Data Analysts in Norway are in high demand, especially those with strong technical skills like Python, SQL, and Power BI. However, their salaries are generally lower compared to Data Scientists, highlighting a potential area for career growth or upskilling.

- The most valuable skills combine high demand and salary potential. Learning tools such as Python, Power BI, and cloud platforms like BigQuery or GCP can position professionals for better-paying roles and increased job opportunities in the Norwegian tech market.
